    about me:<br>
    my name is Iwan der Kinderen. I am a Dutch game developer.<br>
    my ambitions are to eventually create my own games with probably a small team to work together like a tight friend group.<br>
    you should hire me because I am a driven worker who focuses on following the instructions and prioritizes quality over quantity.
