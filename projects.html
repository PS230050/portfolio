Cube shooter
<br/>
<img src="img/cubeshooter.png">
<br>
    Cube shooter is a game in which you shoot blocks coming towards you.<br>
    I made this project all by myself with from time to time some help from a teacher.<br>
    I made this game as my first ever experience with unity to learn game development while making a game that could get me accepted into the Sint Lucas College.<br>
    I used cs files to program all the mechanics of the game and made the game itself in unity.
